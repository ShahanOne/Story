<p>So the story goes like there was a kid who lost both his parents at a very early age to a mob protest caused by the infamous maniac of gotham named "Joker".the boy's life continued in the guidance of their family butler named Alfred. he took good care of him and tried his best to keep that kid away from the darkness which was upon his life.</p>
But fate had something else planned. The boy later in came to become the world's greatest detective and crime fighter, "Batman"
<br>
<br>
HE SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE FIGHTING CRIMINALS , THINKING IT WOULD FREE HIM FROM HIS GRIEVANCE , HIS SUFFERING , HIS REGRETS , BUT ALL IT DID WAS DIVIDE HIM INTO TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES.
